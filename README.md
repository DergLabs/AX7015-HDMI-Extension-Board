# AX7015-HDMI-Extension-Board

This is a simple two port input (RX) and Output (TX) HDMI addon board for the Alinx AX7015 FPGA Card. This board uses the included GPIO pins along with two HDMI driver IC's to provide a direct connect HDMI interface from the FPGA, avoiding the need to use the onboard Silicon Image HDMI Driver Chips which are limited to 1080P 60FPS.
